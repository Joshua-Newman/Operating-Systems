Lab #3
Newman / Weaver

- In the code, created the new functions readSector(char*, int, int) and writeSector (char*, int, int), following the parameters set by Dr. O'Neil in the description.  
- Coded these as interrupt ax options 2 and 6 in the handleInterrupt21() function.

- Used the first version of main() as described in the lab Description, and created the version of floppya.img to include the contents of msg.

- Then, modified the clearScreen(int, int) function, adding the parameters to change the background and foreground colors.  Tested this with the second version of main() (which is what is in the submitted kernel.c).  Included the config version of the floppya.img as instructed, included in the submitted ZIP.
